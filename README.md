# Rare-Events

## Scheduel:

### 05-04-2016
	
* Toy example finished (fixed levels & adaptive levels) 
* maybe there are some bugs in fixed levels

### 06-04-2016

* bugs in fixed-levels algorithm fixed
* remark added in the toy example
* remark corrected
* add fixed-level with adapted levels
* review for the transition kernel

### 07-04-2016

* remark corrected
* permutation trick added (adapted version finished)
* fluctuation analysis for idealized situation started
* bugs in fixed-level version, relative variance added for adapted version

### 08-04-2016
* bug fixed in fixed-levels version
* fluctuation analysis for fixed levels finished

*In fact, it's the choice of the sigma_1 in shaker that cause the problem! The sigma_1 could not be large or small!*

* fluctuation analysis for adapted levels finished(for q = 2.5 to avoid the influence of bias)

### 010-04-2016

* new test results added
* add shaker in the adapted version
